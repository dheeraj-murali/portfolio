I’m just putting this here so that I can follow it as a checklist when setting up mine and it might help you guys too. I’m a web developer, focusing on javascript and node.

## Getting Started

Once you are done booting up and going through the [usual set up](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/macbook-pro/apd831707cb3/mac), make sure your mac is running the latest macOS version and you have [Xcode downloaded from app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).

# Tools

### Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for mac, which helps you install your apps via comand line.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

once installed, give it an update.

```
brew update
```

### Node.js

[Download node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) form their website or install it through **nvm**. It’s better not to use homebrew for just this one. So you can easily switch between node versions.

Download nvm

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
```

Ensure that nvm was installed correctly with `nvm --version`, which should return the version of nvm installed.

Install the latest LTS version with

```
nvm install --lts
```

### Git

You should probably get git when you install Xcode, or you could simply run git from the Terminal the very first time.

```
git --version
```

If it is not already installed, it will prompt you to install it. You can also get a macOS installer from the [git website](https://git-scm.com).

or with Homebrew

```
brew install git
```

Additionally, you can download the GUI for GitHub from [here](https://desktop.github.com). If thats your thing.

### Window management tool

MacOS never had a built in window management solution as good has windows does, but you can get away with it with 3rd party apps like Rectangle, download from their [website](https://rectangleapp.com) or with brew.

```
brew cask rectangle
```

---

# Applications

### Visual Studio code

It is my got to text editor for all things web, it got plenty of features, and you can always find an extension for almost anything.

Download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) or

```
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

### Browsers

You’ve got [Safari](https://www.apple.com/in/safari/) pre installed, and since its web development, you’d probably need to check you website in different browsers. So, lets get the rest of them...

- Chrome — https://www.google.com/chrome/
- Firefox — https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
- Opera — https://www.opera.com/hi

with brew;

```
brew cask install google-chrome firefox opera
```

### Yarn

An alternative to npm.

```
brew install yarn
```

### Spotify

Well, what is life without some music.

```
brew cask install spotify
```

### ImageOptim

ImageOptim helps you optimise an compress images for your website, download it form [here](https://imageoptim.com/mac), or

```
brew cask install imageoptim
```

### For messaging and communications

Microsoft Teams for work and WhatsApp for friends and family.

```
