If you are building a web application that involves a lot of charts, [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) is one of the best open source choice you can find. Built on top of D3 Plotly is a high level charting library which has over 40 types of charts including ones in 3D.

To get plotly running in react you need to use a react wrapper called [react-plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js). This library comes with a dependency of needing plotly.js, despite it's huge bundle size; 6Mb unminified, and minifies to just over 2Mb(_There are ways to bring down the bundle size, but more on that later_) I still believe it is still one of the easiest high-level declarative charting library that you can use with react today.

## Installing and using react-plotly

```
npm install react-plotly.js plotly.js
```

A point to note here, as of the time of writing this blog, ploty.js is a client-side rendering library and doesn't yet support server side rendering.

The most basic usage goes like...

```js
import React from "react";
import Plot from "react-plotly.js";

export function PlotlyChart() {
  return (
    <Plot
      data={[
        {
          x: [1, 2, 3],
          y: [2, 6, 3],
          type: "scatter",
          marker: { color: "red" },
        },
      ]}
      layout={{ width: 320, height: 240, title: "A Fancy Plot" }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Bringing the bundle size down

As I mentioned Plotly support over 40 types of charts, you may not need all of them, or ever half of them in your project. Having a 2MB dependency hanging around in you project is not always the best idea.

Plotly provides couple of ways to get around this issues. One of them is Partial bundles, a subset of all the plotly charts which comes in a smaller bundle size. You can find complete details on these over [here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/dist/README.md)

Or else, if you are feeling a bit hacky you can create a custom bundle tailor made for your project with only the charts you need. More on that [here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CUSTOM_BUNDLE.md)

For this tutorial let's go with _minified plotly.js basic_ partial bundle which packages around 999 kB.

install using

```
npm i plotly.js-basic-dist-min
```

Using this version require a bit of a work than before.

_1._ import the minified package that we just added

```js
import Plotly from "plotly.js-basic-dist-min";
```

_2._ Import react-plotly factory function

```js
import createPlotlyComponent from "react-plotly.js/factory";
```

_3._ Create the `Plot` component form the `Plotly` import using the factory function

```js
const Plot = createPlotlyComponent(Plotly);
```

Well there you go, you can now use your Plotly chart as the `Polt` component.

Oh, and itâ€™s now safe to remove the Plotly.js dependency from your package.json file. We are not using it anymore.

```js
import React from "react";
import Plotly from "plotly.js-basic-dist-min";
import createPlotlyComponent from "react-plotly.js/factory";

const Plot = createPlotlyComponent(Plotly);

export function PlotlyChart() {
  return (
    <Plot
      data={[
        {
          x: [1, 2, 3],
          y: [2, 6, 3],
          type: "scatter",
          marker: { color: "red" },
        },
      ]}
      layout={{ width: 320, height: 240, title: "A Fancy Plot" }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Adding typescript support

react-plotly.js does not come with native typescript support, but you can get the declaration provided by `@types/react-plotly.js`

```js
npm install -d @types/react-plotly.js
```

One big problem here is, if you are using the partial bundles, you may not get a type declaration for that specific bundle at all. But there is workaround for that.

Add type roots to you `tsconfig` file.

```json
"typeRoots": [
    "src/types/customTypings", // this path may vary depending on you project set up.
    "node_modules/@types"
  ]
```

create a `plotly.js-cartesian-dist-min.d.ts` file in your custom typings folder and add the below code.

```js
declare module "plotly.js-cartesian-dist-min" {
  import * as Plotly from "plotly.js";
  export default Plotly;
}
```

We are importing plotly.js declarations that came with `@types/react-plotly.js` and exporting it as declarations for `plotly.js-cartesian-dist-min`. This will provides all the types required for the `Plot` component and our partial bundle.

## Making the chart responsive

To make the chart responsive _when the window is resized_, define height and width either by using `styles` prop or by using `className` and of cause you can use `width: 100%; height: 100%`.

You also need to set `useResizeHandler` prop to true, while setting `layout.autosize` to true and leaving `layout.height` and `layout.width` undefined.

```js
import React from "react";
import Plotly from "plotly.js-basic-dist-min";
import createPlotlyComponent from "react-plotly.js/factory";

const Plot = createPlotlyComponent(Plotly);

export function PlotlyChart() {
  return (
    <Plot
      data={[
        {
          x: [1, 2, 3],
          y: [2, 6, 3],
          type: "scatter",
          marker: { color: "red" },
        },
      ]}
      layout={{ autosize: true, title: "A Fancy Plot" }}
      useResizeHandler
      className="w-full h-full" // I am using tailwind.css here, scss or just css would work fine as well
    />
  );
}
```

### The Problem

Now, the key thing to note here is

> To make the chart responsive **when the window is resized**

What if your window size doesn't change? what if you have some element, let's say a sidebar that pops in and out which changes the width of you component?

Plotly's resize function depends on window resizing, it will only trigger when it detects a change in window size.

### The Solution

Trigger the resize function manually!

```js
Plotly.Plots.resize();
```

Ya I know, it doesn't sounds like much, But I had to searched far and wide to finally find a solution to get this working. So here you go. The basics goes like this.

- use an effect to trigger the layout resize function
- Find a trigger in your app to run the effect. This depends on your use case.

In my case, I triggered the effect every time the sidebar came in and out.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  Plotly.Plots.resize();
}, [showSideBar]);
```

Don't want all your charts to resize? Yep, I got that covered as well..

Add a prop `divId` to your `Plot` component and use this as an argument to the `resize` function.

the final code would look something like

```js
import React from "react";
import Plotly from "plotly.js-basic-dist-min";
import createPlotlyComponent from "react-plotly.js/factory";

const Plot = createPlotlyComponent(Plotly);

export function PlotlyChart({ sideBarOpen }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    Plotly.Plots.resize("plotlyChart");
  }, [sideBarOpen]);

  return (
    <Plot
      divId="plotlyChart"
      data={[
        {
          x: [1, 2, 3],
          y: [2, 6, 3],
          type: "scatter",
          marker: { color: "red" },
        },
      ]}
      layout={{ autosize: true, title: "A Fancy Plot" }}
      useResizeHandler
      className="w-full h-full" // I am using tailwind.css here, scss or just css would work fine as well
    />
  );
}
```

## Bonus Tip

Because the way how react-plotly works, the chart type is actually defined by the `data.type` prop of the `Plot` component.

let's say you want to change our line chart example to a bar chat(assuming that the layout stays the same, in most cases you won't be needing to change it), the only thing that changes here is the `data` prop. you can extract it out to keep only a single chart component for your entire project. Neat, eh?!
