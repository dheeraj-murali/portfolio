Keeping a quality and consistent code base is hard if you are working in a team. Even if not in a team, we often tend to not follow guideline that are not enforced. Having a set up to check and and automagically update our code is always better than living with a mess.

This guide aims to setup our react project with tools like

- **typescript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **prettier** for formatting
- **husky** as pre commit hook to make sure we done our job before we commit the code

# Setting up Typescript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing to validate that our code is working correctly.

## create-react-app

Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It also comes with a template with typescript setup.

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

We can now go ahead a rename any **.js** files to **.ts** or **.tsx**

when we start our react project, CRA will create a `tsconfig.json` file for we **every time**. This may not be desireable if we want to modify the `tsconfig.json` for our project. For that we need to create another `config.json` and extend the `tsconfig.json`.

### Adding custom path to tsconfig

create a config file `tsconfig.paths.json` (or any named json file you like). add paths to our project
like below.

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "components/*": ["components/*"],
      "containers/*": ["containers/*"],
      "pages/*": ["pages/*"],
      "router/*": ["router/*"],
      "styles/*": ["styles/*"],
      "utils/*": ["utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## nextJS

Just like CRA next js come with built in support for typescript. To create a typescript project run

```
npx create-next-app --typescript

# or

yarn create next-app --typescript
```

To get started, create an empty `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project:

```
touch tsconfig.json
```

Next.js will automatically configure this file with default values. Providing your own `tsconfig.json` with custom compiler options is also supported.

Then, run next (normally npm run dev or yarn dev) and Next.js will guide you

```
npm run dev

# You'll see instructions like these:
#
# Please install typescript, @types/react, and @types/node by running:
#
#         yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
#
# ...
```

After the installation is complete, We can now go ahead a rename any **.js** files to **.ts** or **.tsx**

### Adding custom path to tsconfig

Unlike CRA it's safe to add your custom configurations directly to your `tsconfig` file here.

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
      ...
      ...
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "components/*": ["components/*"],
      "containers/*": ["containers/*"],
      "pages/*": ["pages/*"],
      "router/*": ["router/*"],
      "styles/*": ["styles/*"],
      "utils/*": ["utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

# Setting up ESLint

ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms and you can also customize ESLint to work exactly the way you need it for your project.

To install ESLint run

```
npm install eslint --save-dev

# or

yarn add eslint --dev
```

to configure ESLint run

```
npx eslint --init

# or

yarn run eslint --init
```

You can follow the instructions to set up eslint as per your likings.
We are going to go with google's predefined set up for now. follow the arrow `>`

```

```

This will create a new file called `.eslintrc.json` at the root of your project. ESLint will now look for the `eslintrc` file and enforce the rules specified with in that file.

[Here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) is the list of all the rules, just in case you want to customize it to your liking.

You can install ESLint plugin for your IDE to get ESLint working in real time. [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) is the link to the extension for VSCode

You might need to append this into your `eslintrc` file to avoid a bug which prevents ESLint from detecting the version of react.

```
settings: {
    react: {
      version: "latest",
    },
  },
```

You can also create `.eslintignore` file to tell ESLint to ignore certain files.

# Setting up Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter that formats your code to your liking for consistency.

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier

# or

yarn add --dev --exact prettier
```

To avoid formation conflicts between **Prettier** and **ESlint** we need to install `eslint-config-prettier` and add prettier to the `extends` array of the `eslintrc` file.

```
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier

# or

yarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier
```

in your `eslintrc` file, modify the `extends` array to

```
extends: ["plugin:react/recommended", "google", "prettier"],
```

To customize prettier rules to your liking create a `.prettierrc` file at the root of you project and add in the rules you need.

```
{
  "endOfLine": "lf",
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "es5"
}
```

You can find full config options [Here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).

You can also create `.prettierignore` file to tell Prettier to ignore certain files.

You might need to install Prettier plugin for your IDE to get Prettier working in real time. [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is the link to the extension for VSCode.

And add the bellow script to your package.json file so we can easily run them when ever we need.

```
"format": "prettier --write ."

```

# Automating Formatting and Linting in VSCode

You can automate the Prettier formatting and ask eslint to fix all the fixable issue by updating the setting in VSCode.

create a `.vscode` folder at root of your directory.
create a `settings.json` inside this folder.
paste the code bellow to make Prettier and ESLint run every time you copy-paste or save a file.

```
{
  "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true,
    "source.fixAll.format": true
  }
}
```

Doing this would let VSCode set these as default settings for yor projects, so that all your team mates can follow the same set of rules.

# Setting up Husky

Husky is a pre commit hooks that helps improves your commits.

We are going to set up husky to to check for 4 things

1. Check **Prettier** formatting to make sure there are no errors or warnings.
2. Check **ESLint** to make sure there are no errors or warnings.
3. Check **Typescript** compiling to make sure there are no errors or warnings.
4. Try and build the project and make sure there are no errors.

To install husky

```
npx husky-init && npm install       # npm

# or
npx husky-init && yarn              # Yarn 1

# or

yarn dlx husky-init --yarn2 && yarn # Yarn 2
```

This will do 2 things

1. add `"prepare": "husky install"` script to our `package.json` file
2. create `.husky` folder with `.gitignore` and `pre-commit` file

Now, we are going to add 4 new scripts to oru `package.json` file to check certain things;

1. `"check-types": "tsc --pretty --noEmit"` to check typescript type safety.
2. `"check-format": "prettier --check ."` to check formatting with prettier.
3. `"check-lint": "eslint . --ext ts --ext tsx --ext js"` to check for lint errors or warnings.
4. `"test-all": "npm run check-format && npm run check-lint && npm run check-types && npm run build",` to test all the above before committing

Now, inside the `.husky` folder which husky created earlier, we are going to modify the `pre-commit` file to check all the commands in sequence and see if any on them has failed. and we'll prevent the commit is any of them has failed.

place the bellow into the `pre-commit` file inside `.husky` folder

```
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

echo 'Checking for formatting, lints, typesafety and building your project before committing'

# Check Prettier standards
npm run check-format ||
(
    echo 'Prettier Check Failed: Run npm run format and try committing again.';
    false;
)

# Check ESLint Standards
npm run check-lint ||
(
        echo 'ESLint Check Failed: Make the changes listed above and try to commit again.'
        false;
)

# Check tsconfig standards
npm run check-types ||
(
    echo 'Fix all the typescript issues listed above and try to commit again.'
    false;
)

# If everything passes...
echo 'All checks passed attempting to build project'

npm run build ||
(
    echo 'build failed: Check the errors above to see why.'
    false;
)

# If everything passes...
echo 'All checks clear. committing the code now.'
```

Now you can go ahead and push quality code all the time!!
